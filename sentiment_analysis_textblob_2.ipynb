But whereas \\\"Lantana\\\" offered some hope and resolution, \\\"Jindabyne\\\" leaves everything unresolved in a bleak way that will leave most viewers unsatisfied, perhaps even cheated.<br /><br />The storyline - the aftermath of a fisherman's discovery of a corpse floating in a remote river - is based on a short story by Raymond Carver. It became an element in Robert Altman's classic 1993 ensemble \\\"Short Cuts\\\". Lawrence uses this theme for an exploration and exposition of relationships within a small Australian community under stress. The movie poses some moral questions \\\"Would you let the discovery of a dead body ruin your good weekend?\\\" and more poignantly for Australians \\\"Would it make any difference if the dead person was an aboriginal?\\\" The acting, especially by Gabriel Byrne and Laura Linney, is commendable. And there are elements of mysticism reinforced by haunting music, not unlike \\\"Picnic at Hanging Rock\\\".<br /><br />If all this sounds like the basis for a great movie - be prepared for a let down, the pace is very slow and the murder is shown near the beginning, thereby eliminating the element of mystery. And so we are left with these desolate lives and a blank finale.\",\n          \"Hammer House of Horror: Witching Time is set in rural England on Woodstock farm where stressed musician David Winter (Jon Finch) lives with his actress wife Mary (Prunella Gee) & is currently composing the music for a horror film. One night while looking for his dog Billy David finds a mysterious woman in his barn, calling herself Lucinda Jessop (Patricia Quinn) she claims to be a witch who has transported herself from 300 years in the past to now. Obviously rather sceptical David has a hard time believing her so he locks her in a room in his farmhouse & calls his doctor Charles (Ian McCulloch) to come examine her, however once he arrives & they enter the room Lucinda has disappeared. Charles puts it down to David drinking too much but over the next few day strange & disturbing things begin to happen to David & Mary...<br /><br />Witching Time was episode 1 from the short lived British anthology horror series produced by Hammer studios for TV & originally aired here in the UK during September 1980, the first of two Hammer House of Horror episodes to be directed by Don Leaver (episode 13 The Mark of Satan being the other) I actually rather liked this. As a series Hammer House of Horror dealt with various different themes & were all unconnected to each other except in name & unsurprisingly Watching Time is a sinister & effective little tale about a witch, the script by Anthony Read benefits from it's slight 50 odd minute duration & moves along at a nice pace. The character's are pretty good as is the dialogue, there are some nice scenes here & I liked the way it never quite reveals whether David & Mary are going crazy or not. I think it's a well structured, entertaining & reasonably creepy horror themed TV show that I enjoyed more than I thought I would.<br /><br />Being made for British TV meant the boys at Hammer had a lower budget than usual, if that was even possible, & as such there is no gorgeous period settings here as in their most well know Frankenstein & Dracula films although the contemporary English setting does give it a certain atmosphere that you can relate to a bit more. Another TV based restriction is that the exploitation levels are lower than you might hope for, there's some nudity & gore but not much although I didn't mind too much as the story here is pretty good. It's well made for what it is & Hammer's experience on their feature films probably helped make these look pretty good, the acting is good as well with genre favourite Ian McCulloch making a bit-part appearance.<br /><br />Witching Time is a good start to the Hammer House of Horror series, as a 50 minute piece of British TV it's pretty damned good, now why don't they make show's like this over here anymore?\",\n          \"What a great cast for this movie. The timing was excellent and there were so many clever lines-several times I was still laughing minutes after they were delivered. I found Manna From Heaven to have some surprising moments and while there were things I was thinking would happen, the way they came together was anything but predictable. This movie is about hope and righting wrongs. I left the theater feeling inspired to do the right thing.

That means that the protagonists graduated in 1972. But almost all of the music played at the dances etc. is from the 1950s and very early 1960s.<br /><br />Having just attended my 30th high school reunion, I can assure you that the last music to be played at a reunion or dance of former high school people is their parents' music.<br /><br />I understand the difficulty of finding relevant 1970s music -- we all know what a desolate time it was musically. But it wasn't completely bereft, and the producers of the film should have taken more care. I found those dance scenes very jarring to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film.<br /><br />This was a bad director and/or producer decision.\",\n          \"If I remember, Ira Gershwin, the lyricist and brother of George, offered the Gershwin catalog for this film and it was snapped up by the producers. In many respects, it was a typical 50's movie musical by the Freed Unit at MGM and directed by Vincente Minelli with a lot of help from Gene Kelly.<br /><br />The Gershwins were, of course, among the greatest of all Broadway musical teams but, in my opinion, George himself was among the greatest of all American composers, period!!! Gene Kelly was, of course, one of the two greatest male dancers of the movie musical (One guess as to the other?) and I don't imagine his casting was ever in doubt. But, I think the rest of the cast needs some explanation: Oscar Levant was a noted personality in his time and, as an actual friend of George Gershwin, he had to be in this film. He was a talented pianist and even a moderately talented composer as well as a noted neurotic and hypochondriac and here, as always, he plays himself.<br /><br />Leslie Caron was an unknown at this time and she was of the French \\\"gamin\\\" type. A talented dancer, she was never a real beauty. George Gu\\u00e9tary who plays the part of Maurice Chavalier, oops, I mean Henri Baurel, was Greek and not French but he certainly is more than OK as a French boulevardier even if a little too young for the part.<br /><br />Gene's hoofer's voice is serviceable here but Gu\\u00e9tary has much the better vocal equipment. Though Gene was better cast elsewhere as, obviously, in \\\"Singin' in the Rain\\\" where his character is much more calculating, even here he shows himself to be something of a heel at times (He was, not for nothing, cast as the original heel Joey in Pal Joey, the Broadway musical.) I was not so enchanted with his \\\"I Got Rhythm\\\" scene with the children which does not appear as spontaneous as was intended in my opinion.<br /><br />I also found Nina Foch's character Milo to be rather irritating.<br /><br />But the highlight of the film is obviously the lengthy ballet at the end of the film based on the title music with sets and costumes in the styles of the great French Impressionist painters.<br /><br />I found it difficult to believe Gene and Oscar, as struggling artists, and I don't think the musical numbers are as well set up as they might be but, on balance, the Gershwin music is very well served in this film.<br /><br />The DVD is well-done with fine clear graphics (when they are supposed to be) and the mono sound is good but a trifle shallow.\",\n          \"Nuri Bilge Ceylan's 2002 film Distant (Uzak)- his third feature film (his first was 1997's black and white The Small Town- Kasaba), is a significant step up from his good but flawed 1999 film Clouds Of May (Mayis Sikintisi). The earlier film had potential, but reeked of a small budget and improvised quality in the worst ways- plot holes and wooden acting from amateurs. That Clouds Of May succeeded on any level was a testament to Ceylan's talent as a budding filmmaker. However, Distant is Ceylan's arrival on the international scene as a great artist, one who has many of the same qualities as other great filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman (although his screenplay is not as dialogue-heavy it is just as brooding, and he lacks Bergman's penchant for close-ups- his shots are usually long shots for exteriors and medium shots for interiors) and Yasujiro Ozu (whose penetrating scenes of contemplation Ceylan reconfigures). The bulk of the film takes place in snowy hibernal Istanbul (the fact that it snows in Turkey will likely surprise some), which lends the film a definite Bergmanian feel, as well as reminding one of some of the bleak snowy urban images from Krzysztof Kieslowski's The Decalogue. The natural images invoke the best of Werner Herzog- as they tend to go on a beat or two longer than standard film theory would dictate- which is what makes them even more memorable, while the urban landscapes range from the nearly Precisionist compositions of Michelangelo Antonioni to the cultural hagiography of Woody Allen- one shot of a bench overlooking water is a direct quotation (read steal) from Manhattan, save the lack of the Brooklyn Bridge in the background. In another scene, Ceylan similarly quotes a famous shot of a ship in the harbor from Ozu's Tokyo Story. Yet, like all great artists, Ceylan makes his appropriations his own art, by slightly altering them and keeping them apropos to his own film's needs\\u0085. Distant is a film whose title suffuses the characterization within the film and the feeling some viewers will have toward them, but it does not describe the film itself, for scenes stay with one long after the film ends. Perhaps the most memorable scene and image of the film comes when Mahmut stalks his ex-wife at the Istanbul airport, and watches her with her new husband as they head to board the plane that will remove her from his life forever. As he watches her, from a distance, we see her catch just a glance of him watching her. Will she leave her husband and return to Mahmut? Not in this film. He pulls back behind a column, and Nazan merely turns her head back to her future. Mahmut is her past, and she knows how to best move on- just keep moving. Mahmut will never get it. Most rarely get such moments of insight into themselves of life. That some viewers will get the film, and that Ceylan gets his own powers of creation, shows that ignorance can teach, as long as one moves about it. Distant does, albeit it at just the right length.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

That means that the protagonists graduated in 1972. But almost all of the music played at the dances etc. is from the 1950s and very early 1960s.<br /><br />Having just attended my 30th high school reunion, I can assure you that the last music to be played at a reunion or dance of former high school people is their parents' music.<br /><br />I understand the difficulty of finding relevant 1970s music -- we all know what a desolate time it was musically. But it wasn't completely bereft, and the producers of the film should have taken more care. I found those dance scenes very jarring to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film.<br /><br />This was a bad director and/or producer decision.\",\n          \"If I remember, Ira Gershwin, the lyricist and brother of George, offered the Gershwin catalog for this film and it was snapped up by the producers. In many respects, it was a typical 50's movie musical by the Freed Unit at MGM and directed by Vincente Minelli with a lot of help from Gene Kelly.<br /><br />The Gershwins were, of course, among the greatest of all Broadway musical teams but, in my opinion, George himself was among the greatest of all American composers, period!!! Gene Kelly was, of course, one of the two greatest male dancers of the movie musical (One guess as to the other?) and I don't imagine his casting was ever in doubt. But, I think the rest of the cast needs some explanation: Oscar Levant was a noted personality in his time and, as an actual friend of George Gershwin, he had to be in this film. He was a talented pianist and even a moderately talented composer as well as a noted neurotic and hypochondriac and here, as always, he plays himself.<br /><br />Leslie Caron was an unknown at this time and she was of the French \\\"gamin\\\" type. A talented dancer, she was never a real beauty. George Gu\\u00e9tary who plays the part of Maurice Chavalier, oops, I mean Henri Baurel, was Greek and not French but he certainly is more than OK as a French boulevardier even if a little too young for the part.<br /><br />Gene's hoofer's voice is serviceable here but Gu\\u00e9tary has much the better vocal equipment. Though Gene was better cast elsewhere as, obviously, in \\\"Singin' in the Rain\\\" where his character is much more calculating, even here he shows himself to be something of a heel at times (He was, not for nothing, cast as the original heel Joey in Pal Joey, the Broadway musical.) I was not so enchanted with his \\\"I Got Rhythm\\\" scene with the children which does not appear as spontaneous as was intended in my opinion.<br /><br />I also found Nina Foch's character Milo to be rather irritating.<br /><br />But the highlight of the film is obviously the lengthy ballet at the end of the film based on the title music with sets and costumes in the styles of the great French Impressionist painters.<br /><br />I found it difficult to believe Gene and Oscar, as struggling artists, and I don't think the musical numbers are as well set up as they might be but, on balance, the Gershwin music is very well served in this film.<br /><br />The DVD is well-done with fine clear graphics (when they are supposed to be) and the mono sound is good but a trifle shallow.\",\n          \"Nuri Bilge Ceylan's 2002 film Distant (Uzak)- his third feature film (his first was 1997's black and white The Small Town- Kasaba), is a significant step up from his good but flawed 1999 film Clouds Of May (Mayis Sikintisi). The earlier film had potential, but reeked of a small budget and improvised quality in the worst ways- plot holes and wooden acting from amateurs. That Clouds Of May succeeded on any level was a testament to Ceylan's talent as a budding filmmaker. However, Distant is Ceylan's arrival on the international scene as a great artist, one who has many of the same qualities as other great filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman (although his screenplay is not as dialogue-heavy it is just as brooding, and he lacks Bergman's penchant for close-ups- his shots are usually long shots for exteriors and medium shots for interiors) and Yasujiro Ozu (whose penetrating scenes of contemplation Ceylan reconfigures). The bulk of the film takes place in snowy hibernal Istanbul (the fact that it snows in Turkey will likely surprise some), which lends the film a definite Bergmanian feel, as well as reminding one of some of the bleak snowy urban images from Krzysztof Kieslowski's The Decalogue. The natural images invoke the best of Werner Herzog- as they tend to go on a beat or two longer than standard film theory would dictate- which is what makes them even more memorable, while the urban landscapes range from the nearly Precisionist compositions of Michelangelo Antonioni to the cultural hagiography of Woody Allen- one shot of a bench overlooking water is a direct quotation (read steal) from Manhattan, save the lack of the Brooklyn Bridge in the background. In another scene, Ceylan similarly quotes a famous shot of a ship in the harbor from Ozu's Tokyo Story. Yet, like all great artists, Ceylan makes his appropriations his own art, by slightly altering them and keeping them apropos to his own film's needs\\u0085. Distant is a film whose title suffuses the characterization within the film and the feeling some viewers will have toward them, but it does not describe the film itself, for scenes stay with one long after the film ends. Perhaps the most memorable scene and image of the film comes when Mahmut stalks his ex-wife at the Istanbul airport, and watches her with her new husband as they head to board the plane that will remove her from his life forever. As he watches her, from a distance, we see her catch just a glance of him watching her. Will she leave her husband and return to Mahmut? Not in this film. He pulls back behind a column, and Nazan merely turns her head back to her future. Mahmut is her past, and she knows how to best move on- just keep moving. Mahmut will never get it. Most rarely get such moments of insight into themselves of life. That some viewers will get the film, and that Ceylan gets his own powers of creation, shows that ignorance can teach, as long as one moves about it. Distant does, albeit it at just the right length.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

protagonist graduate in but almost all of the music play at the dance etc be from the s and very early sbr br having just attend my th high school reunion I can assure you that the last music to be play at a reunion or dance of former high school people be their parent musicbr br I understand the difficulty of find relevant s music we all know what a desolate time it be musically but it be not completely bereft and the producer of the film should have take more care I find those dance scene very jarring to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the filmbr br this be a bad director andor producer decision\",\n          \"if I remember Ira Gershwin the lyricist and brother of George offer the Gershwin catalog for this film and it be snap up by the producer in many respect it be a typical s movie musical by the Freed Unit at MGM and direct by Vincente Minelli with a lot of help from Gene Kellybr br the Gershwins be of course among the great of all Broadway musical team but in my opinion George himself be among the great of all american composer period Gene Kelly be of course one of the two great male dancer of the movie musical one guess as to the other and I do not imagine his casting be ever in doubt but I think the rest of the cast need some explanation Oscar Levant be a note personality in his time and as an actual friend of George Gershwin he have to be in this film he be a talented pianist and even a moderately talented composer as well as a note neurotic and hypochondriac and here as always he play himselfbr br Leslie Caron be an unknown at this time and she be of the french gamin type a talented dancer she be never a real beauty George Gutary who play the part of Maurice Chavalier oop I mean Henri Baurel be greek and not french but he certainly be more than ok as a French boulevardi even if a little too young for the partbr br Genes hoofer voice be serviceable here but Gutary have much the well vocal equipment Though Gene be well cast elsewhere as obviously in Singin in the Rain where his character be much more calculate even here he show himself to be something of a heel at time he be not for nothing cast as the original heel Joey in Pal Joey the Broadway musical I be not so enchanted with his I get Rhythm scene with the child which do not appear as spontaneous as be intend in my opinionbr br I also find Nina Fochs character Milo to be rather irritatingbr br but the highlight of the film be obviously the lengthy ballet at the end of the film base on the title music with set and costume in the style of the great french Impressionist paintersbr br I find it difficult to believe Gene and Oscar as struggle artist and I do not think the musical number be as well set up as they might be but on balance the Gershwin music be very well serve in this filmbr br the dvd be welldone with fine clear graphic when they be suppose to be and the mono sound be good but a trifle shallow\",\n          \"Nuri Bilge Ceylans film Distant Uzak his third feature film his first be s black and white the Small Town Kasaba be a significant step up from his good but flawed film Clouds of May Mayis Sikintisi the early film have potential but reek of a small budget and improvise quality in the bad way plot hole and wooden acting from amateur that Clouds of May succeed on any level be a testament to Ceylans talent as a bud filmmaker however Distant be Ceylans arrival on the international scene as a great artist one who have many of the same quality as other great filmmaker like Ingmar Bergman although his screenplay be not as dialogueheavy it be just as brood and he lack Bergmans penchant for closeup his shot be usually long shot for exterior and medium shot for interior and Yasujiro Ozu whose penetrate scene of contemplation Ceylan reconfigure the bulk of the film take place in snowy hibernal Istanbul the fact that it snow in Turkey will likely surprise some which lend the film a definite bergmanian feel as well as remind one of some of the bleak snowy urban image from Krzysztof Kieslowskis the Decalogue the natural image invoke the good of Werner Herzog as they tend to go on a beat or two long than standard film theory would dictate which be what make they even more memorable while the urban landscape range from the nearly precisionist composition of Michelangelo Antonioni to the cultural hagiography of Woody Allen one shot of a bench overlook water be a direct quotation read steal from Manhattan save the lack of the Brooklyn Bridge in the background in another scene Ceylan similarly quote a famous shot of a ship in the harbor from Ozus Tokyo Story yet like all great artist Ceylan make his appropriation his own art by slightly alter they and keep they apropo to his own film need Distant be a film whose title suffuse the characterization within the film and the feeling some viewer will have toward they but it do not describe the film itself for scene stay with one long after the film end perhaps the most memorable scene and image of the film come when Mahmut stalk his exwife at the Istanbul airport and watch she with her new husband as they head to board the plane that will remove she from his life forever as he watch she from a distance we see her catch just a glance of he watch she will she leave her husband and return to Mahmut not in this film he pull back behind a column and Nazan merely turn her head back to her future Mahmut be her past and she know how to well move on just keep move Mahmut will never get it most rarely get such moment of insight into themselves of life that some viewer will get the film and that Ceylan get his own power of creation show that ignorance can teach as long as one move about it Distant do albeit it at just the

play at a reunion or dance of former high school people be their parent musicbr br I understand the difficulty of find relevant s music we all know what a desolate time it be musically but it be not completely bereft and the producer of the film should have take more care I find those dance scene very jarring to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the filmbr br this be a bad director andor producer decision\",\n          \"if I remember Ira Gershwin the lyricist and brother of George offer the Gershwin catalog for this film and it be snap up by the producer in many respect it be a typical s movie musical by the Freed Unit at MGM and direct by Vincente Minelli with a lot of help from Gene Kellybr br the Gershwins be of course among the great of all Broadway musical team but in my opinion George himself be among the great of all american composer period Gene Kelly be of course one of the two great male dancer of the movie musical one guess as to the other and I do not imagine his casting be ever in doubt but I think the rest of the cast need some explanation Oscar Levant be a note personality in his time and as an actual friend of George Gershwin he have to be in this film he be a talented pianist and even a moderately talented composer as well as a note neurotic and hypochondriac and here as always he play himselfbr br Leslie Caron be an unknown at this time and she be of the french gamin type a talented dancer she be never a real beauty George Gutary who play the part of Maurice Chavalier oop I mean Henri Baurel be greek and not french but he certainly be more than ok as a French boulevardi even if a little too young for the partbr br Genes hoofer voice be serviceable here but Gutary have much the well vocal equipment Though Gene be well cast elsewhere as obviously in Singin in the Rain where his character be much more calculate even here he show himself to be something of a heel at time he be not for nothing cast as the original heel Joey in Pal Joey the Broadway musical I be not so enchanted with his I get Rhythm scene with the child which do not appear as spontaneous as be intend in my opinionbr br I also find Nina Fochs character Milo to be rather irritatingbr br but the highlight of the film be obviously the lengthy ballet at the end of the film base on the title music with set and costume in the style of the great french Impressionist paintersbr br I find it difficult to believe Gene and Oscar as struggle artist and I do not think the musical number be as well set up as they might be but on balance the Gershwin

potential but reek of a small budget and improvise quality in the bad way plot hole and wooden acting from amateur that Clouds of May succeed on any level be a testament to Ceylans talent as a bud filmmaker however Distant be Ceylans arrival on the international scene as a great artist one who have many of the same quality as other great filmmaker like Ingmar Bergman although his screenplay be not as dialogueheavy it be just as brood and he lack Bergmans penchant for closeup his shot be usually long shot for exterior and medium shot for interior and Yasujiro Ozu whose penetrate scene of contemplation Ceylan reconfigure the bulk of the film take place in snowy hibernal Istanbul the fact that it snow in Turkey will likely surprise some which lend the film a definite bergmanian feel as well as remind one of some of the bleak snowy urban image from Krzysztof Kieslowskis the Decalogue the natural image invoke the good of Werner Herzog as they tend to go on a beat or two long than standard film theory would dictate which be what make they even more memorable while the urban landscape range from the nearly precisionist composition of Michelangelo Antonioni to the cultural hagiography of Woody Allen one shot of a bench overlook water be a direct quotation read steal from Manhattan save the lack of the Brooklyn Bridge in the background in another scene Ceylan similarly quote a famous shot of a ship in the harbor from Ozus Tokyo Story yet like all great artist Ceylan make his appropriation his own art by slightly alter they and keep they apropo to his own film need Distant be a film whose title suffuse the characterization within the film and the feeling some viewer will have toward they but it do not describe the film itself for scene stay with one long after the film end perhaps the most memorable scene and image of the film come when Mahmut stalk his exwife at the Istanbul airport and watch she with her new husband as they head to board the plane that will remove she from his life forever as he watch she from a distance we see her catch just a glance of he watch she will she leave her husband and return to Mahmut not in this film he pull back behind a column and Nazan merely turn her head back to her future Mahmut be her past and she know how to well move on just keep move Mahmut will never get it most rarely get such moment of insight
